        Support custom attributes to PlayerView:
        1. Orientation - Control the orientation of PlayerView main linear layout, such that we can
                         configure it to be either horizontal or vertical, based on the location of
                         the player around the table.
        2. Reverse - Whether to reverse the order of children of PlayerView or not.
                     By default, the order is profile image first, and then name + chips.
                     In order to be able to paint the name+chips before the image, we have
                     introduced the "reverse" parameter, so we will re-arrange children.
